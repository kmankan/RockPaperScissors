Rock Paper Scissors

The Problem: 
Write a program that allows the user to enter a case-insensitive RPS option (e.g. "Rock"), 
randomly generate a computer oppoisition response and print for the user the outcome - 
i.e. whether they won or lost.
Play five rounds of the game and keep score - reporting a winner or loser at the end.

Pseudocode:
Ask user to input their move
Check that move is valid
If the move is valid, store it
generate random computer response, store it
If the user wins print "You Win! x beats y"
If the user loses print "You Lose! y beats x"
If it is a tie print "It's a tie!"
